### Travel Hub

This is a simple experiment to implement a nextjs application on Vercel and use some tools I have not used frequently.

-   ShadCn UI library
-   Supabase with Prisma
-   Clerk
-   Tailwinds
-   Zod
-   Stripe
-   Vercel deployment

This was only possible by the great tutorial of John Smilga the codding addict...

### Development needs

1. .env.local file needs to define the Clerk definitions
2. .env for Subabase
3. install prisma and run locally...
   <code>npx prisma studio</code>
